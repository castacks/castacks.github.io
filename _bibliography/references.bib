    decide on further exploration, or to decide which data to share for cooperation.
    These scenarios often require fast deployment with little or no training data.
    Prior work considers "interestingness" based on data from the same distribution.
    Instead, we propose to develop a method that automatically adapts online to the
    environment to report interesting scenes quickly. To address this problem, we
    develop a novel translation-invariant visual memory and design a three-stage
    architecture for long-term, short-term, and online learning, which enables the
    system to learn human-like experience, environmental knowledge, and online
    adaption, respectively. With this system, we achieve an average of 20% higher
    accuracy than the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods in a subterranean
    tunnel environment. We show comparable performance to supervised methods for
    robot exploration scenarios showing the efficacy of our approach. We expect
    that the presented method will play an important role in the robotic
    interestingness recognition exploration tasks.}

The core challenges in developing a motion-capture system that operates in outdoors environments are: (1) 3D inference requires multiple simultaneous viewpoints of the target, (2) occlusion caused by obstacles is frequent when tracking moving targets, and (3) the camera and vehicle state estimation is noisy. We present a real-time aerial system for multi-camera control that can reconstruct human motions in natural environments without the use of special-purpose markers. We develop a multi-robot coordination scheme that maintains the optimal flight formation for target reconstruction quality amongst obstacles. We provide studies evaluating system performance in simulation, and validate real-world performance using two drones while a target performs activities such as jogging and playing soccer.}

  To alleviate manual efforts, we propose GIDSeg, a novel approach that can simultaneously learn segmentation from sparse annotations via reasoning global-regional structures and individual-vicinal properties.
  GIDSeg depicts global- and individual- relation via a dynamic edge convolution network coupled with a kernelized identity descriptor.
  The ensemble effects are obtained by endowing a fine-grained receptive field to a low-resolution voxelized map.
  In our GIDSeg, an adversarial learning module is also designed to further enhance the conditional constraint of identity descriptors within the joint feature distribution.
  Despite the apparent simplicity, our proposed approach achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art for inferencing 3D dense segmentation with only sparse annotations.
  Particularly, with 5% annotations of raw data, GIDSeg outperforms other 3D segmentation methods.}

  The problem is challenging because correspondences of local invariant features are inconsistent across the domains between image and 3D.
  The problem is even more challenging as the method must handle various environmental conditions such as illumination, weather, and seasonal changes.
  Our method can match equirectangular images to the 3D range projections by extracting cross-domain symmetric place descriptors.
  Our key insight is to retain condition-invariant 3D geometry features from limited data samples while eliminating the condition-related features by a designed Generative Adversarial Network.
  Based on such features, we further design a spherical convolution network to learn viewpoint-invariant symmetric place descriptors.
  We evaluate our method on extensive self-collected datasets, which involve \textit{Long-term} (variant appearance conditions), \textit{Large-scale} (up to 2km structure/unstructured environment), and \textit{Multistory} (four-floor confined space).
  Our method surpasses other current state-of-the-arts by achieving around 3 times higher place retrievals to inconsistent environments, and above 3 times accuracy on online localization.
  To highlight our method's generalization capabilities, we also evaluate the recognition across different datasets. With a single trained model, i3dLoc can demonstrate reliable visual localization in random conditions.}

Operational parameters, such as commanded ground speed, payload, and cruise altitude, are varied for each flight. This large data set has a total flight time of 10 hours and 45 minutes and was collected from April to October of 2019 covering a total distance of approximately 65 kilometers.

various efforts in constructing and maintaining
high-resolution world representations to acquire positions

However, those “optimal” selections could quickly become
obsolete due to the influx of new information, especially
in large-scale environments, which results in
high-frequency re-planning that hinders the exploration
efﬁciency. In this paper, we propose a graph-based
topological planning framework, building a sparse
topological map in three-dimensional (3D) space to guide
exploration steps with high-level intents so as to render
consistent exploration maneuvers. Specifically, this work
presents a novel method to represent 3D spaces as convex
polyhedrons, whose geometry information is utilized to
group spaces into distinctive regions. These distinctive
regions are then added as nodes into the topological map,
directing the exploration process. We compared our method
with the state-of-art in simulated environments. The
proposed method achieves better exploration performance in
space coverage and outperforms exploration efﬁciency
by more than 40%. Finally, a field experiment was conducted
to further evaluate the applicability of our method to
empower efficient and robust exploration in real-world
environments.}

with a diverse range of shots in a photo-realistic

semantic descriptors for each clip. Next, we analyze
correlations between descriptors and build a semantic
control space based on cinematography guidelines and human

that can map a set of desired semantic video descriptors
into low-level camera trajectory parameters. We evaluate
our system by demonstrating that our model successfully
generates shots that are rated by participants as having
the expected degrees of expression for each descriptor. We
also show that our models generalize to different scenes in
both simulation and real-world experiments. More results

Professional productions, however, require the use of
multiple cameras simultaneously to record different
viewpoints of the same scene, which are edited into the
final footage either in real time or in post-production.
Such extreme motion coordination is particularly hard for
unscripted action scenes, which are a common use case of
aerial cameras. In this work we develop a real-time
multi-UAV coordination system that is capable of recording
dynamic targets while maximizing shot diversity and
avoiding collisions and mutual visibility between cameras.
We validate our approach in multiple cluttered environments

two UAVs in real-world experiments. We show that our

algorithm to address these problems by incorporating a
learned model to account for complexities that would be too

vehicle will be able to follow a potential plan in a given
environment. These predictions are then used to assign
costs to their associated paths, where the path predicted
to be the most feasible will be output as the final path.
This results in a planner that doesn't rely solely on
engineered features to evaluate traversability of
obstacles, and can also choose a better path based on an
understanding of its own capability that it has learned

energy consumption, as running out of battery during a

we propose a deep energy model that uses Temporal
Convolutional Networks (TCNs) to capture the time varying
features while incorporating static contextual information.
Our energy model is trained on a real world dataset and
doesn't require segregating flights into regimes. We
showcase an improvement in power predictions by 35.6% on
test flights when compared to a state-of-the-art analytical
method. Once we have an accurate energy model, we can use
it to predict the energy usage for a given trajectory and
evaluate the risk of running out of battery during flight.
We propose using Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) as a
metric for quantifying this risk. We show that CVaR
captures the risk associated with worst-case energy
consumption on a nominal path by transforming the output
distribution of Monte Carlo forward simulations into a risk
space and computing the CVaR on the risk-space
distribution. Our state-of-the-art energy model and risk

abstract = {The introduction of fully-actuated multirotors has opened the door to new possibilities and more efficient solutions to many real-world applications. However, their integration had been slower than expected, partly due to the need for new tools to take full advantage of these robots.
As far as we know, all the groups currently working on the fully-actuated multirotors develop new full-pose (6-D) tools and methods to use their robots, which is inefficient, time-consuming, and requires many resources.
We propose a way of bridging the gap between the tools already available for underactuated robots and the new fully-actuated vehicles. The approach can extend the existing underactuated flight controllers to support the fully-actuated robots, or enhance the existing fully-actuated controllers to support existing underactuated flight stacks. We introduce attitude strategies that work with the underactuated controllers, tools, planners and remote control interfaces, all while allowing taking advantage of the full actuation. Moreover, new methods are proposed that can properly handle the limited lateral thrust suffered by many fully-actuated UAV designs. The strategies are lightweight, simple, and allow rapid integration of the available tools with these new vehicles for the fast development of new real-world applications.
The real experiments on our robots and simulations on several UAV architectures with different underlying controller methods show how these strategies can be utilized to extend existing flight controllers for fully-actuated applications. We have provided the source code for the PX4 firmware enhanced with our proposed methods to showcase an example flight controller for underactuated multirotors that can be modified to seamlessly support fully-actuated vehicles while retaining the rest of the flight stack unchanged.

It additionally includes many hours of raw data of fully autonomous, autopilot-assisted and manual flights with tens of fault scenarios. The ground truth of the time and type of faults is provided in each scenario to enable evaluation of the methods using the dataset. We have also provided the helper tools in several programming languages to load and work with the data and to help the evaluation of a detection method using the dataset. A set of metrics is proposed to help to compare different methods using the dataset. Most of the current fault detection methods are evaluated in simulation and, as far as we know, this dataset is the only one providing the real flight data with faults in such capacity.

We propose a 1-point RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm which is able to perform outlier rejection across features from all stereo pairs. To handle the problem of noisy extrinsics, we account for uncertainty in the calibration of each stereo pair and model it in both our front-end and back-end. The result is a VIO system which is able to maintain an accurate state estimate under conditions that have typically proven to be challenging for traditional state-of-the-art VIO systems. We demonstrate the benefits of our proposed multi-stereo algorithm by evaluating it with both simulated and real world data.

While similar data structures have been proposed, we avoid processing redundant occupancy information and use the organization of the grid to improve efficiency. By layering 3D circular buffers that double in resolution at each level, obstacles near the robot are represented at finer resolutions while coarse spatial information is maintained at greater distances. We also introduce a novel method for efficiently calculating the Euclidean distance transform on the multiresolution grid by leveraging its structure.

  abstract  = {A high-quality estimate of wind fields can potentially improve the safety and performance of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) operating in dense urban areas. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations can help provide a wind field estimate, but their accuracy depends on the knowledge of the distribution of the inlet boundary conditions. This paper provides a real-time methodology using a Particle Filter (PF) that utilizes wind measurements from a UAV to solve the inverse problem of predicting the inlet conditions as the UAV traverses the flow field. A Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) approach is used as a surrogate function to maintain the real-time nature of the proposed methodology. Real-world experiments with a UAV at an urban test-site prove the efficacy of the proposed method. The flight test shows that the 95%confidence interval for the difference between the mean estimated inlet conditions and mean ground truth measurements closely bound zero, with the difference in mean angles being between −3.7° and 1.3° and the difference in mean magnitudes being between −0.2 m/s and 0.0 m/s.

This area is currently under explored but is crucial for many practical applications such as autonomous exploration and decision making. First, we expect a robot to detect novel and interesting scenes in unknown environments and lose interests over time after repeatedly observing similar objects. Second, we expect the robots to learn from unbalanced data in a short time, as the robots normally only know the uninteresting scenes before they are deployed. Inspired by those industrial demands, we first propose a novel translation-invariant visual memory for recalling and identifying interesting scenes, then design a three-stage architecture of long-term, short-term, and online learning for human-like experience, environmental knowledge, and online adaption, respectively. It is demonstrated that our approach is able to learn online and find interesting scenes for practical exploration tasks. It also achieves a much higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art algorithm on very challenging robotic interestingness prediction datasets.},

We apply this method to the problem of detecting safe landing zones for autonomous helicopters from LiDAR point clouds. Current methods for this problem rely on heuristic rules and use simple geometric features. These heuristics break down in the presence of low vegetation, as they do not distinguish between vegetation that may be landed on and solid objects that should be avoided. We evaluate the system with a combination of real and synthetic range data.

The main motivation for this integration is the solution of UAVs' motion planning problems that are easily and intuitively solved using vector fields, but are very difficult to be even posed as optimal motion planning problems, mainly due to the lack of clear cost functions. Examples of such problems include the ones where a goal configuration is not defined, such as circulation of curves, loitering and road following. While several vector field methodologies were proposed to solve these tasks, they are susceptible to failures in the presence of previously unmodeled obstacles, including no-fly zones specified during the flight. Our framework uses a vector field as a high level specification of a task and an optimal motion planner (in our case RRT - ) as a local, on-line planner that generates paths that follow the vector field, but also consider the new obstacles encountered by the vehicle during the flight. A series of simulations illustrate and validate the proposed methodology. One of these simulations considers a rotorcraft UAV equipped with a spinning laser patrolling an urban area in the presence of unmodeled obstacles and no-fly zones.},

For instance, camera images are of higher resolution and have colors, while LiDAR data provide more accurate range measurements and have a wider field of view. However, the sensor fusion problem remains challenging since it is difficult to find reliable correlations between data of very different characteristics (geometry versus texture, sparse versus dense). This letter proposes an offline LiDAR-camera fusion method to build dense, accurate 3-D models. Specifically, our method jointly solves a bundle adjustment problem and a cloud registration problem to compute camera poses and the sensor extrinsic calibration. In experiments, we show that our method can achieve an average accuracy of 2.7 mm and resolution of 70 points/cm2 by comparing to the ground truth data from a survey scanner. Furthermore, the extrinsic calibration result is discussed and shown to outperform the state-of-the-art method.},

abstract = {State estimation is the most critical capability for MAV (Micro-Aerial Vehicle) localization, autonomous obstacle avoidance, robust flight control and 3D environmental mapping. There are three main challenges for MAV state estimation: (1) it can deal with aggressive 6 DOF (Degree Of Freedom) motion; (2) it should be robust to intermittent GPS (Global Positioning System) (even GPS-denied) situations; (3) it should work well both for low- and high-altitude flight. In this paper, we present a state estimation technique by fusing long-range stereo visual odometry, GPS, barometric and IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) measurements. The new estimation system has two main parts, a stochastic cloning EKF (Extended Kalman Filter) estimator that loosely fuses both absolute state measurements (GPS, barometer) and the relative state measurements (IMU, visual odometry), and is derived and discussed in detail. A long-range stereo visual odometry is proposed for high-altitude MAV odometry calculation by using both multi-view stereo triangulation and a multi-view stereo inverse depth filter. The odometry takes the EKF information (IMU integral) for robust camera pose tracking and image feature matching, and the stereo odometry output serves as the relative measurements for the update of the state estimation. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset and our real flight dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed state estimation system, especially for the aggressive, intermittent GPS and high-altitude MAV flight.},

Current methodologies for evaluating or ensuring safety either do not guarantee safety or severely limit the performance of rotorcraft. To design a guaranteed safe rotorcraft, we have defined safety for an autonomous rotorcraft flying in unknown environments given sensory and dynamic constraints. We have developed an approach that ensures the vehicle's safety while pushing the limits of safe operation of the vehicle. Furthermore, the presented safety definition and the presented approach are independent of the vehicle and planning algorithm used on the rotorcraft. In this paper we present a real time algorithm to guarantee the safety of the rotorcraft through a diverse set of emergency maneuvers.

abstract = {Stereo cameras are a popular choice for obstacle avoidance for outdoor lighweight, low-cost robotics applications. However, they are unable to sense thin and reflective objects well. Currently, many algorithms are tuned to perform well on indoor scenes like the Middlebury dataset. When navigating outdoors, reflective objects, like windows and glass, and thin obstacles, like wires, are not well handled by most stereo disparity algorithms. Reflections, repeating patterns and objects parallel to the cameras' baseline causes mismatches between image pairs which leads to bad disparity estimates. Thin obstacles are difficult for many sliding window based disparity methods to detect because they do not take up large portions of the pixels in the sliding window. We use a trinocular camera setup and micropolarizer camera capable of detecting reflective objects to overcome these issues. We present a hierarchical disparity algorithm that reduces noise, separately identify wires using semantic object triangulation in three images, and use information about the polarization of light to estimate the disparity of reflective objects. We evaluate our approach on outdoor data that we collected. Our method contained an average of 9.27{\%} of bad pixels compared to a typical stereo algorithm's 18.4{\%} of bad pixels in scenes containing reflective objects. Our trinocular and semantic wire disparity methods detected 53{\%} of wire pixels, whereas a typical two camera stereo algorithm detected 5{\%}.},

Consequently, our work focuses on improving the compatibility across different sensing payloads. Specifically, we extend the Cartographer SLAM library to handle different types of LiDAR including fixed or rotating, 2D or 3D LiDARs. By replacing the localization module of Cartographer and maintaining the sparse pose graph (SPG), the proposed framework can create high-quality 3D maps in real-time on different sensing payloads.

Although there has been a plethora of work on the individual topics of planning long routes, smooth trajectory optimization and planning in a wind field, it is difficult for these methods to scale to solve the combined problem. In this paper, we address the problem of planning long, dynamically feasible, time-optimal trajectories in the presence of wind (which creates a moving reference frame). We present an algorithm, $\kappa$ITE, that elegantly decouples the joint trajectory optimization problem into individual path optimization in a fixed ground frame and a velocity profile optimization in a moving reference frame. The key idea is to derive a decoupling framework that guarantees feasibility of the final fused trajectory. Our results show that $\kappa$ITE is able to produce high-quality solutions for planning with a helicopter flying at speeds of 50 m/s, handling winds up to 20 m/s and missions over 200 km. We validate our approach with real-world experiments on a full-scale helicopter with a pilot in the loop.

While there is an extensive amount of prior work investigating effective practical approximations using variants of Shannon's entropy, the efficacy of such policies heavily depends on the geometric distribution of objects in the world. On the other hand, the principled approach of employing online POMDP solvers is rendered impractical by the need to explicitly sample online from a posterior distribution of world maps. We present a novel data-driven imitation learning framework to efficiently train information gathering policies. The policy imitates a clairvoyant oracle - an oracle that at train time has full knowledge about the world map and can compute maximally informative sensing locations. We analyze the learnt policy by showing that offline imitation of a clairvoyant oracle is implicitly equivalent to online oracle execution in conjunction with posterior sampling. This observation allows us to obtain powerful near-optimality guarantees for information gathering problems possessing an adaptive sub-modularity property. As demonstrated on a spectrum of 2D and 3D exploration problems, the trained policies enjoy the best of both worlds - they adapt to different world map distributions while being computationally inexpensive to evaluate.},

First, the proposed method divides the raw point cloud into multiscale supervoxels, and considers planar supervoxels and individual points corresponding to nonplanar supervoxels as basic units. Then, an efficient hybrid region growing algorithm is utilized to generate initial plane set by incrementally merging adjacent basic units with similar features. Next, the initial plane set is further enriched and refined in a mutually reinforcing manner under the framework of global energy optimization. Finally, the performances of the proposed method are evaluated with respect to six metrics (i.e., plane precision, plane recall, under-segmentation rate, over-segmentation rate, boundary precision, and boundary recall) on two benchmark datasets. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method obtained good performances both in high-quality TLS point clouds (i.e., SEMANTIC3D.NET dataset) and low-quality RGB-D point clouds (i.e., S3DIS dataset) with six metrics of (94.2{\%}, 95.1{\%}, 2.9{\%}, 3.8{\%}, 93.6{\%}, 94.1{\%}) and (90.4{\%}, 91.4{\%}, 8.2{\%}, 7.6{\%}, 90.8{\%}, 91.7{\%}) respectively.},

There is a growing need for methods to monitor the status of these aircraft and report any faults and anomalies to the safety pilot or to the autopilot to deal with the emergency situation. In this paper, we present a real-time approach using the Recursive Least Squares method to detect anomalies in the behavior of an aircraft. The method models the relationship between correlated input-output pairs online and uses the model to detect the anomalies. The result is an easy-to-deploy anomaly detection method that does not assume a specific aircraft model and can detect many types of faults and anomalies in a wide range of autonomous aircraft. The experiments on this method show a precision of 88.23{\%}, recall of 88.23{\%} and 86.36{\%} accuracy for over 22 flight tests. The other contribution is providing a new fault detection open dataset for autonomous aircraft, which contains complete data and the ground truth for 22 fixed-wing flights with eight different types of mid-flight actuator failures to help future fault detection research for aircraft.},

abstract = {Aerial cinematography is revolutionizing industries that require live and dynamic camera viewpoints such as entertainment, sports, and security. However, safely piloting a drone while filming a moving target in the presence of obstacles is immensely taxing, often requiring multiple expert human operators. Hence, there is a demand for an autonomous cinematographer that can reason about both geometry and scene context in real-time. Existing approaches do not address all aspects of this problem; they either require high-precision motion-capture systems or global positioning system tags to localize targets, rely on prior maps of the environment, plan for short time horizons, or only follow fixed artistic guidelines specified before the flight. In this study, we address the problem in its entirety and propose a complete system for real-time aerial cinematography that for the first time combines: (a) vision-based target estimation; (b) 3D signed-distance mapping for occlusion estimation; (c) efficient trajectory optimization for long time-horizon camera motion; and (d) learning-based artistic shot selection. We extensively evaluate our system both in simulation and in field experiments by filming dynamic targets moving through unstructured environments. Our results indicate that our system can operate reliably in the real world without restrictive assumptions. We also provide in-depth analysis and discussions for each module, with the hope that our design tradeoffs can generalize to other related applications.

Current approaches either only handle off-line trajectory generation, or offer strategies that reason over short time horizons and simplistic representations for obstacles, which result in jerky movement and low real-life applicability. In this work we develop a method for aerial filming that is able to trade off shot smoothness, occlusion, and cinematography guidelines in a principled manner, even under noisy actor predictions. We present a novel algorithm for real-time covariant gradient descent that we use to efficiently find the desired trajectories by optimizing a set of cost functions. Experimental results show that our approach creates attractive shots, avoiding obstacles and occlusion 65 times over 1.25 hours of flight time, re-planning at 5 Hz with a 10 s time horizon.

An autonomous landing system is capable of reacting quickly to regain control, however current emergency landing methods focus only on the offline generation of dynamically feasible trajectories while ignoring the more severe constraints faced while autonomously landing a real helicopter during an unplanned engine failure. We address the problem of autonomously landing a helicopter while considering a realistic context: hard time-constraints, challenging terrain, sensor limitations and availability of pilot contextual knowledge. We designed a planning system that deals with all these factors by being able to compute alternate routes (AR) in a rapid fashion. This paper presents an algorithm, RRT*-AR, building upon the optimal sampling-based algorithm RRT* to generate AR in realtime while maintaining optimality guarantees and examines its performance for simulated failures occurring in mountainous terrain. After over 4500 trials, RRT*-AR outperformed RRT* by providing the human 280{\%} more options 67{\%} faster on average. As a result, it provides a much wider safety margin for unaccounted disturbances, and a more secure environment for a pilot. {\textcopyright} 2013 by the American Helicopter Society International, Inc.

While many rivers can be mapped from satellite imagery, smaller rivers that pass through dense vegetation are occluded. We develop a micro air vehicle (MAV) that operates beneath the tree line, detects and maps the river, and plans paths around three-dimensional (3D) obstacles (such as overhanging tree branches) to navigate rivers purely with onboard sensing, with no GPS and no prior map. We present the two enabling algorithms for exploration and for 3D motion planning. We extract high-level goal-points using a novel exploration algorithm that uses multiple layers of information to maximize the length of the river that is explored during a mission. We also present an efficient modification to the SPARTAN (Sparse Tangential Network) algorithm called SPARTAN-lite, which exploits geodesic properties on smooth manifolds of a tangential surface around obstacles to plan rapidly through free space. Using limited onboard resources, the exploration and planning algorithms together compute trajectories through complex unstructured and unknown terrain, a capability rarely demonstrated by flying vehicles operating over rivers or over ground. We evaluate our approach against commonly employed algorithms and compare guidance decisions made by our system to those made by a human piloting a boat carrying our system over multiple kilometers.

abstract = {We consider the problem of real-time motion planning that requires evaluating a minimal number of edges on a graph to quickly discover collision-free paths. Evaluating edges is expensive, both for robots with complex geometries like robot arms, and for robots sensing the world online like UAVs. Until now, this challenge has been addressed via laziness i.e. deferring edge evaluation until absolutely necessary, with the hope that edges turn out to be valid. However, all edges are not alike in value - some have a lot of potentially good paths flowing through them, and some others encode the likelihood of neighbouring edges being valid. This leads to our key insight - instead of passive laziness, we can actively choose edges that reduce the uncertainty about the validity of paths. We show that this is equivalent to the Bayesian active learning paradigm of decision region determination (DRD). However, the DRD problem is not only combina-torially hard, but also requires explicit enumeration of all possible worlds. We propose a novel framework that combines two DRD algorithms, DIRECT and BISECT, to overcome both issues. We show that our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms on a spectrum of planning problems for mobile robots, manipulators and autonomous helicopters.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a method for single image three-dimensional (3-D) cuboid object detection and multiview object simultaneous localization and mapping in both static and dynamic environments, and demonstrate that the two parts can improve each other. First, for single image object detection, we generate high-quality cuboid proposals from two-dimensional (2-D) bounding boxes and vanishing points sampling. The proposals are further scored and selected based on the alignment with image edges. Second, multiview bundle adjustment with new object measurements is proposed to jointly optimize poses of cameras, objects, and points. Objects can provide long-range geometric and scale constraints to improve camera pose estimation and reduce monocular drift. Instead of treating dynamic regions as outliers, we utilize object representation and motion model constraints to improve the camera pose estimation. The 3-D detection experiments on SUN RGBD and KITTI show better accuracy and robustness over existing approaches. On the public TUM, KITTI odometry and our own collected datasets, our SLAM method achieves the state-of-the-art monocular camera pose estimation and at the same time, improves the 3-D object detection accuracy.},

abstract = {Robot planning is the process of selecting a sequence of actions that optimize for a task=specific objective. For instance, the objective for a navigation task would be to find collision-free paths, whereas the objective for an exploration task would be to map unknown areas. The optimal solutions to such tasks are heavily influenced by the implicit structure in the environment, i.e. the configuration of objects in the world. State-of-the-art planning approaches, however, do not exploit this structure, thereby expending valuable effort searching the action space instead of focusing on potentially good actions. In this paper, we address the problem of enabling planners to adapt their search strategies by inferring such good actions in an efficient manner using only the information uncovered by the search up until that time. We formulate this as a problem of sequential decision making under uncertainty where at a given iteration a planning policy must map the state of the search to a planning action. Unfortunately, the training process for such partial-information-based policies is slow to converge and susceptible to poor local minima. Our key insight is that if we could fully observe the underlying world map, we would easily be able to disambiguate between good and bad actions. We hence present a novel data-driven imitation learning framework to efficiently train planning policies by imitating a clairvoyant oracle: an oracle that at train time has full knowledge about the world map and can compute optimal decisions. We leverage the fact that for planning problems, such oracles can be efficiently computed and derive performance guarantees for the learnt policy. We examine two important domains that rely on partial-information-based policies: informative path planning and search-based motion planning. We validate the approach on a spectrum of environments for both problem domains, including experiments on a real UAV, and show that the learnt policy consistently outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. Our framework is able to train policies that achieve up to 39{\%} more reward than state-of-the art information-gathering heuristics and a 70 x speedup as compared with A* on search-based planning problems. Our approach paves the way forward for applying data-driven techniques to other such problem domains under the umbrella of robot planning.},

abstract = {As part of swarm search and service (SSS) missions, robots are tasked with servicing jobs as they are sensed. This requires small sub-swarm teams to leave the swarm for a specified amount of time to service the jobs. In doing so, fewer robots are required to change motion than if the whole swarm were diverted, thereby minimizing the job's overall effect on the swarm's main goal. We explore the problem of removing the required number of robots from the swarm, while maintaining overall swarm connectivity. By preserving connectivity, robots are able to successfully rejoin the swarm upon completion of their assigned job. These robots are then made available for reallocation. We propose a decentralized and asynchronous method for breaking off sub-swarm groups and rejoining them with the main swarm using the swarm's communication graph topology. Both single and multiple job site cases are explored. The results are compared against a full swarm movement method. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms a full swarm method in the average number of messages sent per robot in each step, as well as, the distance traveled by the swarm.},

The state-of-the-art stereo reconstruction methods, both learning and non-learning ones, consume too much computational resource on high-resolution data. Recent learning-based methods achieve top ranks on most benchmarks. However, they suffer from the generalization issue due to lack of task-specific training data. We propose to use a less resource demanding non-learning method, guided by a learning-based model, to handle high-resolution images and achieve accurate stereo reconstruction. The deep-learning model produces an initial disparity prediction with uncertainty for each pixel of the down-sampled stereo image pair. The uncertainty serves as a self-measurement of its generalization ability and the per-pixel searching range around the initially predicted disparity. The downstream process performs a modified version of the Semi-Global Block Matching method with the up-sampled per-pixel searching range. The proposed deep-learning assisted method is evaluated on the Middlebury dataset and high-resolution stereo images collected by our customized binocular stereo camera. The combination of learning and non-learning methods achieves better performance on 12 out of 15 cases of the Middlebury dataset.

abstract = {Swarm search and service (SSS) missions require large swarms to simultaneously search an area while servicing jobs as they are encountered. Jobs must be immediately serviced and can be one of several different job types - each requiring a different service time and number of vehicles to complete its service successfully. After jobs are serviced, vehicles are returned to the swarm and become available for reallocation. As part of SSS mission planning, human operators must determine the number of vehicles needed to achieve this balance. The complexities associated with balancing vehicle allocation to multiple as yet unknown tasks with returning vehicles makes this extremely difficult for humans. Previous work assumes that all system jobs are known ahead of time or that vehicles move independently of each other in a multi-agent framework. We present a dynamic vehicle routing (DVR) framework whose policies optimally allocate vehicles as jobs arrive. By incorporating time constraints into the DVR framework, an M/M/k/k queuing model can be used to evaluate overall steady state system performance for a given swarm size. Using these estimates, operators can rapidly compare system performance across different configurations, leading to more effective choices for swarm size. A sensitivity analysis is performed and its results are compared with the model, illustrating the appropriateness of our method to problems of plausible scale and complexity.},

abstract = {Agile MAVs are required to operate in cluttered, unstructured environments at high speeds and low altitudes for efficient data gathering. Given the payload constraints and long range sensing requirements, cameras are the preferred sensing modality for MAVs. The computation burden of using cameras for obstacle sensing has forced the state of the art methods to construct world representations on a per frame basis, leading to myopic decision making. In this paper we propose a long range perception and planning approach using cameras. By utilizing FPGA hardware for disparity calculation and image space to represent obstacles, our approach and system design allows for construction of long term world representation whilst accounting for highly non-linear noise models in real time. We demonstrate these obstacle avoidance capabilities on a quadrotor flying through dense foliage at speeds of up to 4 m/s for a total of 1.6 hours of autonomous flights. The presented approach enables high speed navigation at low altitudes for MAVs for terrestrial scouting.},

abstract = {Wire detection, depth estimation and avoidance is one of the hardest challenges towards the ubiquitous presence of robust autonomous aerial vehicles. We present an approach and a system which tackles these three challenges along with generic obstacle avoidance as well. First, we perform monocular wire detection using a convolutional neural network under the semantic segmentation paradigm, and obtain a confidence map of wire pixels. Along with this, we also use a binocular stereo pair to detect other generic obstacles. We represent wires and generic obstacles using a disparity space representation and do a C-space expansion by using a non-linear sensor model we develop. Occupancy inference for collision checking is performed by maintaining a pose graph over multiple disparity images. For avoidance of wire and generic obstacles, we use a precomputed trajectory library, which is evaluated in an online fashion in accordance to a cost function over proximity to the goal. We follow this trajectory with a path tracking controller. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in simulation for wire mapping, and on hardware by multiple runs for both wire and generic obstacle avoidance.},

abstract = {When operating in partially-known environments, autonomous vehicles must constantly update their maps and plans based on new sensor information. Much focus has been placed on developing efficient incremental planning algorithms that are able to efficiently replan when the map and associated cost function changes. However, much less attention has been placed on efficiently updating the cost function used by these planners, which can represent a significant portion of the time spent replanning. In this paper, we present the Limited Incremental Distance Transform algorithm, which can be used to efficiently update the cost function used for planning when changes in the environment are observed. Using this algorithm it is possible to plan paths in a completely incremental way starting from a list of changed obstacle classifications. We present results comparing the algorithm to the Euclidean distance transform and a mask-based incremental distance transform algorithm. Computation time is reduced by an order of magnitude for a UAV application. We also provide example results from an autonomous micro aerial vehicle with on-board sensing and computing.{\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

abstract = {Autonomous mobile robots are required to operate in partially known and unstructured environments. It is imperative to guarantee safety of such systems for their successful deployment. Current state of the art does not fully exploit the sensor and dynamic capabilities of a robot. Also, given the non-holonomic systems with non-linear dynamic constraints, it becomes computationally infeasible to find an optimal solution if the full dynamics are to be exploited online. In this paper we present an online algorithm to guarantee the safety of the robot through an emergency maneuver library. The maneuvers in the emergency maneuver library are optimized such that the probability of finding an emergency maneuver that lies in the known obstacle free space is maximized. We prove that the related trajectory set diversity problem is monotonic and sub-modular which enables one to develop an efficient trajectory set generation algorithm with bounded sub-optimality. We generate an off-line computed trajectory set that exploits the full dynamics of the robot and the known obstacle-free region. We test and validate the algorithm on a full-size autonomous helicopter flying up to speeds of 56{\textless}sup{\textgreater}m/s{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} in partially-known environments.

We have developed a method of collision avoidance that can be used in three dimensions in much the same way as autonomous ground vehicles that navigate over unexplored terrain. Safe navigation is accomplished by a combination of online environmental sensing, path planning and collision avoidance. Here we outline our methodology and report results with an autonomous helicopter that operates at low elevations in uncharted environments, some of which are densely populated with obstacles such as buildings, trees and wires. We have recently completed over 700 successful runs in which the helicopter traveled between coarsely specified waypoints separated by hundreds of meters, at speeds of up to 10 m s-1 at elevations of 5-11 m above ground level. The helicopter safely avoids large objects such as buildings and trees but also wires as thin as 6 mm. We believe this represents the first time an air vehicle has traveled this fast so close to obstacles.

abstract = {Automatic registration of unordered point clouds collected by the terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) is the prerequisite for many applications including 3D model reconstruction, cultural heritage management, forest structure assessment, landslide monitoring, and solar energy analysis. However, most of the existing point cloud registration methods still suffer from some limitations. On one hand, most of them are considerable time-consuming and high computational complexity due to the exhaustive pairwise search for recovering the underlying overlaps, which makes them infeasible for the registration of large-scale point clouds. On the other hand, most of them only leverage pairwise overlaps and rarely use the overlaps between multiple point clouds, resulting in difficulty dealing with point clouds with limited overlaps. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a Hierarchical Merging based Multiview Registration (HMMR) algorithm to align unordered point clouds from various scenes. First, the multi-level descriptors (i.e., local descriptor: Binary Shape Context (BSC) and global descriptor: Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptor (VLAD)) are calculated. Second, the point clouds overlapping (adjacent) graph is efficiently constructed by leveraging the similarity between their corresponding VLAD vectors. Finally, the proposed method hierarchically registers multiple point clouds by iteratively performing optimal registration point clouds calculation, BSC descriptor based pairwise registration and point cloud groups overlapping (adjacent) graph update, until all the point clouds are aligned into a common coordinate reference. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm obtains good performance in terms of successful registration rate, rotation error, translation error, and runtime, and outperformed the state-of-the-art approaches.},

abstract = {Autonomous flight of unmanned full-size rotor-craft has the potential to enable many new applications. However, the dynamics of these aircraft, prevailing wind conditions, the need to operate over a variety of speeds and stringent safety requirements make it difficult to generate safe plans for these systems. Prior work has shown results for only parts of the problem. Here we present the first comprehensive approach to planning safe trajectories for autonomous helicopters from takeoff to landing. Our approach is based on two key insights. First, we compose an approximate solution by cascading various modules that can efficiently solve different relaxations of the planning problem. Our framework invokes a long-term route optimizer, which feeds a receding-horizon planner which in turn feeds a high-fidelity safety executive. Secondly, to deal with the diverse planning scenarios that may arise, we hedge our bets with an ensemble of planners. We use a data-driven approach that maps a planning context to a diverse list of planning algorithms that maximize the likelihood of success. Our approach was extensively evaluated in simulation and in real-world flight tests on three different helicopter systems for duration of more than 109 autonomous hours and 590 pilot-in-the-loop hours. We provide an in-depth analysis and discuss the various tradeoffs of decoupling the problem, using approximations and leveraging statistical techniques. We summarize the insights with the hope that it generalizes to other platforms and applications.},

Then, an online motion planning al-gorithm that combines trajectory optimization with receding horizon control is proposed for fast obstacle avoidance. All the computations are done in real-time onboard our customized MAV platform. We validate the system by running ex-periments in different environmental conditions.

abstract = {Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) offer an elegant framework to model sequential decision making in uncertain environments. Solving POMDPs online is an active area of research and given the size of real-world problems approximate solvers are used. Recently, a few approaches have been suggested for solving POMDPs by using MDP solvers in conjunction with imitation learning. MDP based POMDP solvers work well for some cases, while catastrophically failing for others. The main failure point of such solvers is the lack of motivation for MDP solvers to gain information, since under their assumption the environment is either already known as much as it can be or the uncertainty will disappear after the next step. However for solving POMDP problems gaining information can lead to efficient solutions. In this paper we derive a set of conditions where MDP based POMDP solvers are provably sub-optimal. We then use the well-known tiger problem to demonstrate such sub-optimality. We show that multi-resolution, budgeted information gathering cannot be addressed using MDP based POMDP solvers. The contribution of the paper helps identify the properties of a POMDP problem for which the use of MDP based POMDP solvers is inappropriate, enabling better design choices.},

However, the models obtained in other similar tasks, such as pedestrian collision risk analysis and human-robot interaction, are very difficult to generalize to the aerial filming task, because of the difference in data distributions. Towards improving generalization with less amount of labeled data, this paper presents a semi-supervised algorithm for heading direction estimation problem. We utilize temporal continuity as the unsupervised signal to regularize the model and achieve better generalization ability. This semi-supervised algorithm is applied to both training and testing phases, which increases the testing performance by a large margin. We show that by leveraging unlabeled sequences, the amount of labeled data required can be significantly reduced. We also discuss several important details on improving the performance by balancing labeled and unlabeled loss, and making good combinations. Experimental results show that our approach robustly outputs the heading direction for different types of actor. The aesthetic value of the video is also improved in the aerial filming task.},

With accurate motion prediction of other agents, robots can plan for more intelligent behaviors to achieve specified objectives, instead of acting in a purely reactive way. Previous work addresses motion prediction by either only filtering kinematics, or using hand-designed and learned representations of the environment. Instead of separating kinematic and environmental context, we propose a novel approach to integrate both into an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) framework for trajectory prediction. Instead of exponentially increasing the state-space complexity with kinematics, we propose a two-stage neural network architecture that considers motion and environment together to recover the reward function. The first-stage network learns feature representations of the environment using low-level LiDAR statistics and the second-stage network combines those learned features with kinematics data. We collected over 30 km of off-road driving data and validated experimentally that our method can effectively extract useful environmental and kinematic features. We generate accurate predictions of the distribution of future trajectories of the vehicle, encoding complex behaviors such as multi-modal distributions at road intersections, and even show different predictions at the same intersection depending on the vehicle's speed.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a method of structure inspection using mixed-reality headsets to reduce the human effort in reporting accurate inspection information such as fault locations in 3D coordinates. Prior to every inspection, the headset needs to be localized. While external pose estimation and fiducial marker based localization would require setup, maintenance, and manual calibration; marker-free self-localization can be achieved using the onboard depth sensor and camera. However, due to limited depth sensor range of portable mixed-reality headsets like Microsoft HoloLens, localization based on simple point cloud registration (sPCR) would require extensive mapping of the environment. Also, localization based on camera image would face same issues as stereo ambiguities and hence depends on viewpoint. We thus introduce a novel approach to Joint Point Cloud and Image-based Localization (JPIL) for mixed-reality headsets that uses visual cues and headset orientation to register small, partially overlapped point clouds and save significant manual labor and time in environment mapping. Our empirical results compared to sPCR show average 10 fold reduction of required overlap surface area that could potentially save on average 20 minutes per inspection. JPIL is not only restricted to inspection tasks but also can be essential in enabling intuitive human-robot interaction for spatial mapping and scene understanding in conjunction with other agents like autonomous robotic systems that are increasingly being deployed in outdoor environments for applications like structural inspection.},

The main motivation for this integration is the solution of robot motion planning problems that are easily and intuitively solved using vector fields, but are very difficult to be even posed as an optimal motion planning problem, mainly due to the lack of a clear cost function. Examples of such problems include the ones where a goal configuration is not defined, such as circulation of curves, loitering, road following, etc. While several vector field methodologies were proposed to solve these tasks, they do not explicitly consider the robot's differential constraints and are susceptible to failures in the presence of previously unmodeled obstacles. To add together the good characteristics of each approach, our methodology uses a vector field as a high level specification of a task and an optimal motion planner (in our case RRT*) as a local planner that generates trajectories that follow the vector field, but also consider the kinematics and the dynamics of the robot, as well as the new obstacles encountered by the robot in its workspace.},

abstract = {Robotic motion planning problems are typically solved by constructing a search tree of valid maneuvers from a start to a goal configuration. Limited onboard computation and real-time planning constraints impose a limit on how large this search tree can grow. Heuristics play a crucial role in such situations by guiding the search towards potentially good directions and consequently minimizing search effort. Moreover, it must infer such directions in an efficient manner using only the information uncovered by the search up until that time. However, state of the art methods do not address the problem of computing a heuristic that explicitly minimizes search effort. In this paper, we do so by training a heuristic policy that maps the partial information from the search to decide which node of the search tree to expand. Unfortunately, naively training such policies leads to slow convergence and poor local minima. We present SaIL, an efficient algorithm that trains heuristic policies by imitating "clairvoyant oracles" - oracles that have full information about the world and demonstrate decisions that minimize search effort. We leverage the fact that such oracles can be efficiently computed using dynamic programming and derive performance guarantees for the learnt heuristic. We validate the approach on a spectrum of environments which show that SaIL consistently outperforms state of the art algorithms. Our approach paves the way forward for learning heuristics that demonstrate an anytime nature - finding feasible solutions quickly and incrementally refining it over time.},

abstract = {The performance of a motion planning algorithm is intrinsically linked with applications that respect the assumptions being made. However, the mapping of these assumptions to actual environments is not always transparent. For example, a gradient descent algorithm is capable of tackling a complex opti- mization problem if some assurance of absence of bad local minimas can be ensured - however detecting the local minimas beforehand is very challenging. The state of the art technique relies on an expert to analyze the application, deduce assumptions that the planner can leverage and subsequently make key design decisions. In this work, we make an attempt to learn a mapping from environments to specific planning assumptions. This paper presents a diverse ensemble of planners that exploit very different aspects of the planning problem. A classifier is then trained to approximate the mapping from environment to performance difference between a pair of planners. Preliminary results hints at the role played by convexity, whilst also demonstrating the difficulty of the classification task at hand.},

abstract = {Machines are a long way from robustly solving open-world perception-control tasks, such as first-person view (FPV) aerial navigation. While recent advances in end-to-end Machine Learning, especially Imitation and Reinforcement Learning appear promising, they are constrained by the need of large amounts of difficult-to-collect labeled real-world data. Simulated data, on the other hand, is easy to generate, but generally does not render safe behaviors in diverse real-life scenarios. In this work we propose a novel method for learning robust visuomotor policies for real-world deployment which can be trained purely with simulated data. We develop rich state representations that combine supervised and unsupervised environment data. Our approach takes a cross-modal perspective, where separate modalities correspond to the raw camera data and the system states relevant to the task, such as the relative pose of gates to the drone in the case of drone racing. We feed both data modalities into a novel factored architecture, which learns a joint low-dimensional embedding via Variational Auto Encoders. This compact representation is then fed into a control policy, which we trained using imitation learning with expert trajectories in a simulator. We analyze the rich latent spaces learned with our proposed representations, and show that the use of our cross-modal architecture significantly improves control policy performance as compared to end-to-end learning or purely unsupervised feature extractors. We also present real-world results for drone navigation through gates in different track configurations and environmental conditions. Our proposed method, which runs fully onboard, can successfully generalize the learned representations and policies across simulation and reality, significantly outperforming baseline approaches.

In this paper, we propose a LiDAR-enhanced SfM pipeline that jointly processes data from a rotating LiDAR and a stereo camera pair to estimate sensor motions. We show that incorporating LiDAR helps to effectively reject falsely matched images and significantly improve the model consistency in large-scale environments.

Despite continuous improvements, automatic registration of 2D and 3D data without using additional textured information still faces great challenges. In this paper, we propose a new 2D-3D registration method to estimate 2D-3D line feature correspondences and the camera pose in untextured point clouds of structured environments. Specifically, we first use geometric constraints between vanishing points and 3D parallel lines to compute all feasible camera rotations. Then, we utilize a hypothesis testing strategy to estimate the 2D-3D line correspondences and the translation vector. By checking the consistency with computed correspondences, the best rotation matrix can be found. Finally, the camera pose is further refined using non-linear optimization with all the 2D-3D line correspondences. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on the synthetic and real dataset (outdoors and indoors) with repeated structures and rapid depth changes.},

Our ultimate goal is to enable MAVs to perform autonomous scouting. In this paper, we describe a semantic mapping system designed to support this goal. The system maintains a 2.5D map describing its belief about the location of semantic classes of interest, using forward-looking cameras and state estimation. The map is continuously updated on the fly, using only onboard processing. The system couples a deep learning 2D semantic segmentation algorithm with a novel mapping method to project and aggregate the 2D semantic measurements into a global 2.5D grid map. We train and evaluate our segmentation method on a novel dataset of cars labelled in oblique aerial imagery. We also study the performance of the mapping system in isolation.

abstract = {Currently deployed unmanned rotorcraft rely on preplanned missions or teleoperation and do not actively incorporate information about obstacles, landing sites, wind, position uncertainty, and other aerial vehicles during online motion planning. Prior work has successfully addressed some tasks such as obstacle avoidance at slow speeds, or landing at known to be good locations. However, to enable autonomous missions in cluttered environments, the vehicle has to react quickly to previously unknown obstacles, respond to changing environmental conditions, and find unknown landing sites. We consider the problem of enabling autonomous operation at low-altitude with contributions to four problems. First we address the problem of fast obstacle avoidance for a small aerial vehicle and present results from over a 1000 rims at speeds up to 10 m/s. Fast response is achieved through a reactive algorithm whose response is learned based on observing a pilot. Second, we show an algorithm to update the obstacle cost expansion for path planning quickly and demonstrate it on a micro aerial vehicle, and an autonomous helicopter avoiding obstacles. Next, we examine the mission of finding a place to land near a ground goal. Good landing sites need to he detected and found and the final touch down goal is unknown. To detect the landing sites we convey a model based algorithm for landing sites that incorporates many helicopter relevant constraints such as landing sites, approach, abort, and ground paths in 3D range data. The landing site evaluation algorithm uses a patch-based coarse evaluation for slope and roughness, and a fine evaluation that fits a 3D model of the helicopter and landing gear to calculate a goodness measure. The data are evaluated in real-time to enable the helicopter to decide on a place to land. We show results from urban, vegetated, and desert environments, and demonstrate the first autonomous helicopter that selects its own landing sites. We present a generalized planning framework that enables reaching a goal point, searching for unknown landing sites, and approaching a landing zone. In the framework, sub-objective functions, constraints, and a state machine define the mission and behavior of an UAV. As the vehicle gathers information by moving through the environment, the objective functions account for this new information. The operator in this framework can directly specify his intent as an objective function that defines the mission rather than giving a sequence of pre-specified goal points. This allows the robot to react to new information received and adjust its path accordingly. The objective is used in a combined coarse planning and trajectory optimization algorithm to determine the best patch the robot should take. We show simulated results for several different missions and in particular focus on active landing zone search. We presented several effective approaches for perception and action for low-altitude flight and demonstrated their effectiveness in field experiments on three autonomous aerial vehicles: a 1m quadrocopter, a 36m helicopter, and a hill-size helicopter. These techniques permit rotorcraft to operate where they have their greatest advantage: In unstructured, unknown environments at low-altitude.},

Military applications seek to combine the benefits of ground and air vehicles to maximize flexibility of movement but require that the operator have minimal pilot training. This makes the operator vulnerable to automation complexity issues; however, the operator will expect to be able to interact extensively and control the vehicle during flight. A mixed-initiative control approach mitigates these vulnerabilities by integrating the operator into many complex control domains in the way that they often expect—flexibly in charge, aware, but not required to issue every command. Intrinsic safety aspects were evaluated by comparing performance, decision making, precision, and workload for three RAV control paradigms: human-only, fully automated, and mixed-initiative control. The results suggest that the mixed-initiative paradigm leverages the benefits of human and automated control while also avoiding the drawbacks associated with each.},

Currently, visual and visual-inertial odometry (VO$\backslash${\&}VIO) techniques are well-developed for state estimation but with inevitable accumulated drifts and pose jumps upon loop closure. To overcome these problems, we propose an efficient monocular camera localization method in prior LiDAR maps using directly estimated 2D-3D line correspondences. To handle the appearance differences and modality gaps between untextured point clouds and images, geometric 3D lines are extracted offline from LiDAR maps while robust 2D lines are extracted online from video sequences. With the pose prediction from VIO, we can efficiently obtain coarse 2D-3D line correspondences. After that, the camera poses and 2D-3D correspondences are iteratively optimized by minimizing the projection error of correspondences and rejecting outliers. The experiment results on the EurocMav dataset and our collected dataset demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently estimate camera poses without accumulated drifts or pose jumps in urban environments.

In this work, we introduce a real-time, model-based, multi-view algorithm to reconstruct wires from a set of images with known camera poses, while exploiting their natural shape-the catenary curve. Using a model-based approach helps us deal with partial wire detections in images, which may occur due to natural occlusion and false negatives. In addition, using a parsimonious model makes our algorithm efficient as we only need to optimize for 5 model parameters, as opposed to hundreds of 3D points in bundle-adjustment approaches. Our algorithm obviates the need for pixel correspondences by computing the reprojection error via the distance transform of binarized wire segmentation images. Further, we make our algorithm robust to arbitrary initializations by introducing an on-demand, approximate extrapolation of the distance transform based objective. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm against false negatives and random initializations in simulation, and show qualitative results with real data collected from a small UAV.},

abstract = {Robotic motion-planning problems, such as a UAV flying fast in a partially-known environment or a robot arm moving around cluttered objects, require finding collision-free paths quickly. Typically, this is solved by constructing a graph, where vertices represent robot configurations and edges represent potentially valid movements of the robot between these configurations. The main computational bottlenecks are expensive edge evaluations to check for collisions. State of the art planning methods do not reason about the optimal sequence of edges to evaluate in order to find a collision free path quickly. In this paper, we do so by drawing a novel equivalence between motion planning and the Bayesian active learning paradigm of decision region determination (DRD). Unfortunately, a straight application of existing methods requires computation exponential in the number of edges in a graph. We present BISECT, an efficient and near-optimal algorithm to solve the DRD problem when edges are independent Bernoulli random variables. By leveraging this property, we are able to significantly reduce computational complexity from exponential to linear in the number of edges. We show that BISECT outperforms several state of the art algorithms on a spectrum of planning problems for mobile robots, manipulators, and real flight data collected from a full scale helicopter.},

abstract = {— This paper presents a methodology to integrate vector field-based robot motion planning tech-niques with optimal trajectory planners. The main motivation for this integration is the solution of planning problems that are intuitively solved using vector fields, but are very difficult to be even posed as an optimal mo-tion planning problem, mainly due to the lack of a clear cost function. Among such problems are the ones where a goal configuration is not defined, such as circulation of curves and road following. While several vector field based methodologies were proposed to solve these tasks, they do not explicitly consider the robot's differential constraints and are susceptible to failures in the presence of previously unmodeled obstacles. Our methodology uses a vector field as a high level specification of a task and an optimal motion planner (in our case RRT*) as a local planner that generates trajectories that follow the vector field and also consider the kinematic and dynamic constraints of the robot, as well as the new obstacles encountered in the workspace. To illustrate the approach, we show simulations with a Dubins like vehicle moving in partially unknown planar environments. Keywords— Robotics, motion planning, vector fields, optimal planning, RRT*.

abstract = {Obstacle avoidance from monocular images is a challenging problem for robots. Though multi-view structure-from-motion could build 3D maps, it is not robust in textureless environments. Some learning based methods exploit human demonstration to predict a steering command directly from a single image. However, this method is usually biased towards certain tasks or demonstration scenarios and also biased by human understanding. In this paper, we propose a new method to predict a trajectory from images. We train our system on more diverse NYUv2 dataset. The ground truth trajectory is computed from the designed cost functions automatically. The Convolutional Neural Network perception is divided into two stages: first, predict depth map and surface normal from RGB images, which are two important geometric properties related to 3D obstacle representation. Second, predict the trajectory from the depth and normal. Results show that our intermediate perception increases the accuracy by 20{\%} than the direct prediction. Our model generalizes well to other public indoor datasets and is also demonstrated for robot flights in simulation and experiments.},

abstract = {Assessing a landing zone (LZ) reliably is essential for safe operation of vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aerial vehicles that land at unimproved locations. Currently an operator has to rely on visual assessment to make an approach decision; however. visual information from afar is insufficient to judge slope and detect small obstacles. Prior work has modeled LZ quality based on plane fitting, which only partly represents the interaction between vehicle and ground. Our approach consists of a coarse evaluation based on slope and roughness criteria, a fine evaluation for skid contact, and body clearance of a location. We investigated whether the evaluation is correct for using terrain maps collected from a helicopter. This paper defines the problem of evaluation, describes our incremental real-time algorithm, and discusses the efectiveness of our approach. In results from urban and natural environments, we were able to successfully classify LZs from point cloud maps collected on a helicopter. The presented method enables detailed assessment of LZs without an landing approach, thereby improving safety. Still, the method assumes low-noise point cloud data. We intend to increase robustness to outliers while still detecting small obstacles in future work.},

abstract = {We address the problem of verifying motion plans for aerial robots in uncertain and partially-known environments. Thereby, the initial state of the robot is uncertain due to errors from the state estimation and the motion is uncertain due to wind disturbances and control errors caused by sensor noise. Since the environment is perceived at runtime, the verification of partial motion plans must be performed online (i.e. during operation) to ensure safety within the planning horizon and beyond. This is achieved by efficiently generating robust control invariant sets based on so-called loiter circles, where the position of the aerial robot follows a circular pattern. Verification of aerial robots is challenging due to the nonlinearity of their dynamics, the high dimensionality of their state space, and their potentially high velocities. We use novel techniques from reachability analysis to overcome those challenges. In order to ensure that the robot never finds itself in a situation for which no safe maneuver exists, we provide a technique that ensures safety of aerial robots beyond the planning horizon. Our method is applicable to all kinds of robotic systems that follow reference trajectories, such as bipedal robotic walking, robotic manipulators, automated vehicles, and the like. We evaluate our method by simulations of high speed helicopter flights.},

This, the ability to rely on robotic systems, depends on our ability to monitor them and intercede when necessary, manually or autonomously. Prior work in this area surveys intrusion detection and security challenges in robotics, but a discussion of the more general anomaly detection problems is lacking. As such, we provide a brief insight-focused discussion and frameworks of thought on some compelling open problems with anomaly detection in robotic systems. Namely, we discuss non-malicious faults, invalid data, intentional anomalous behavior, hierarchical anomaly detection, distribution of computation, and anomaly correction on the fly. We demonstrate the need for additional work in these areas by providing a case study which examines the limitations of implementing a basic anomaly detection (AD) system in the Robot Operating System (ROS) 2 middleware. Showing that if even supporting a basic system is a significant hurdle, the path to more complex and advanced AD systems is even more problematic. We discuss these ROS 2 platform limitations to support solutions in robotic anomaly detection and provide recommendations to address the issues discovered.},

The performance of these sensors can be augmented by actively controlling their configuration for minimizing the expected cost of the mission. The related information gain problem in NP hard. Current methodologies are either computationally too expensive to run online or make simplifying assumptions that fail in complex environments. We present a method to create and learn a policy that maps features calculated online to sensory actions. The policy developed in this work actively controls a nodding lidar to keep the vehicle safe at high velocities and focuses the sensor bandwidth on gaining information relevant for the mission once safety is ensured. It is validated and evaluated on an autonomous full-scale helicopter (Boeing Unmanned Little Bird) equipped with an actively controlled nodding laser. It is able to keep the vehicle safe at its maximum operating velocity, 56 m=s, and reduce the landing zone evaluation time by 500{\%} as compared to passive nodding. The structure of the policy and efficient learning algorithm should generalize to provide a solution for actively controlling a sensor for keeping a mobile robots safe while exploring regions of interest to the robot.},

abstract = {On-board path planning is a key capability for safe autonomous unmanned flight. Recently, it has been shown that using trochoids for turn segments allows for run-time efficient path planning under consideration of the prevailing wind. However, with varying wind conditions and uncertainty in the estimation of wind speed and direction, paths optimized for a reference wind condition may become infeasible to track for the aircraft. In this work, we discuss how to calculate conservative turn rate limits and we present a novel approach to calculate safety distances along trochoidal turn segments in order to account for an unknown wind speed and airspeed component of bounded magnitude. This allows to plan flight paths that are optimized for the currently expected wind condition but are still safe in case the aircraft experiences different wind conditions. We present results from simulation and flight tests which demonstrate the impact of uncertain and varying wind conditions on the tracking performance of paths with circular and trochoidal turn segments. The results show that trochoids can be used to reduce path tracking errors even if the prevailing wind changes significantly. Furthermore, the proposed method to calculate safety distances conservatively over-approximates path deviations in all considered cases. Thus, it can be used to plan safe paths in the presence of uncertain wind conditions without solely relying on conservative performance limits.},

abstract = {Rivers with heavy vegetation are hard to map from the air. Here we consider the task of mapping their course and the vegetation along the shores with the specific intent of determining river width and canopy height. A complication in such riverine environments is that only intermittent GPS may be available depending on the thickness of the surrounding canopy. We present a multimodal perception system to be used for the active exploration and mapping of a river from a small rotorcraft flying a few meters above the water. We describe three key components that use computer vision, laser scanning, and inertial sensing to follow the river without the use of a prior map, estimate motion of the rotorcraft, ensure collision-free operation, and create a three dimensional representation of the riverine environment. While the ability to fly simplifies the navigation problem, it also introduces an additional set of constraints in terms of size, weight and power. Hence, our solutions are cognizant of the need to perform multi-kilometer missions with a small payload. We present experimental results along a 2km loop of river using a surrogate system. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

In this paper, we propose real-time monocular plane SLAM to demonstrate that scene understanding could improve both state estimation and dense mapping especially in low-texture environments. The plane measurements come from a pop-up 3D plane model applied to each single image. We also combine planes with point based SLAM to improve robustness. On a public TUM dataset, our algorithm generates a dense semantic 3D model with pixel depth error of 6.2 cm while existing SLAM algorithms fail. On a 60 m long dataset with loops, our method creates a much better 3D model with state estimation error of 0.67{\%}.},

Least squares method (LSM) is the most common and simple method for position calculation, and various optimization algorithms were designed elaborately for reducing localization error. Unlike other localization papers which focus on designing elaborate localization algorithms, this paper takes a different perspective, focusing on the error propagation problem, addressing questions such as where the localization error comes from and how it propagates. Based on the theory of variance and covariance, a novel simplified error propagation algorithm is proposed to analyse the localization error for triangulation method. This algorithm exactly shows influence of ranging errors and network structure on positioning. Finally, a simulation test in Matlab is carried out to verify the validity of the proposed algorithm, and it is shown that the algorithm significantly simplifies the calulation of the positioning error. The work of this paper can be used for mul-ti-sensor fusion where an accurate error model is required. Besides, error estimation is also useful for error control by optimizing the structure of WSN.},

abstract = {Autonomous landing of a drone is a necessary part of autonomous flight. One way to have high certainty of safety in landing is to return to the same location the drone took-off from. Implementations of return-to-home functionality fall short when relying solely on GPS or odometry as inaccuracies in the measurements and drift in the state estimate guides the drone to a position with a large offset from the initial position. This can be particularly dangerous if the drone took-off next to something like a body of water. Current work on precision landing relies on localizing to a known landing pattern, which requires the pilot to carry a landing pattern with them. We propose a method using a downward facing fisheye lens camera to accurately land a UAV from where it took off on an unstructured surface, without a landing pattern. Specifically, this approach uses a position estimate relative to the take-off path of the drone to guide the drone back. With the large Field-of-View provided by the fisheye lens, our algorithm can provide visual feedback starting with a large position error at the beginning of the landing, until 25cm above the ground at the end of the landing. This algorithm empirically shows it can correct the drift error in the state estimation and land with an accuracy of 40cm.},

This problem is also known as the informative path planning (IPP) problem or correlated orienteering. It can be formalized as that of finding budgeted routes in a graph such that the reward collected by the route is maximized, where the reward at nodes can be dependent. Unfortunately, the problem is NP-Hard and the state of the art methods are too slow to even present an approximate solution online. Here we present Randomized Anytime Orienteering (RAOr) algorithm that provides near optimal solutions while demonstrably converging to an efficient solution in runtimes that allows the solver to be run online. The key idea of our approach is to pose orienteering as a combination of a Constraint Satisfaction Problem and a Traveling Salesman Problem. This formulation allows us to restrict the search space to routes that incur minimum distance to visit a set of selected nodes, and rapidly search this space using random sampling. The paper provides the analysis of asymptotic near-optimality, convergence rates for RAOr algorithms, and present strategies to improve anytime performance of the algorithm.

The system's goal is to provide a richer representation of the environment than a purely geometric map, allowing it to distinguish, e.g., tall grass from obstacles.

The geometric and semantic information are estimated online and in real-time from LiDAR and image sensor data, respectively. Using this semantic map, motion planners can create semantically aware trajectories. To achieve robust and efficient semantic segmentation, we design a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and train it with a novel dataset of labelled off-road imagery built for this purpose. We evaluate our semantic segmentation offline, showing comparable performance to the state of the art with slightly lower latency.

abstract = {Motion planning in the most general sense is an optimization problem with a single elusive best solution. However attempting to find a single answer isn't often the most desired approach. On the one hand, the reason is theoretical - planners often get trapped in local minimas because the cost function has many valleys or dynamics are too complex to fully exploit. On the other hand, there are many practical deterrents - unmapped obstacles might require the system to switch quickly to another plan, unmodelled dynamics can make a computed plan infeasible, or the system may have a human-in-loop who has a vote in the decision process. In situations where the current plan is no longer desirable, a new plan has to be planned. The re-planning time induces a reaction latency which might result in mission failure. We advocate the use of alternate routes (AR), a set of spatially different, locally optimal paths, as a powerful tool to address several of the afore-mentioned issues. By enforcing the routes to be spatially separated, appearance of unexpected obstacles has less chance of rendering all trajectories to be infeasible. In such cases, alternate routes act as a set of backup options which can be switched to instantly. This reduces reaction latency allowing the system to operate with a lower risk. This paper presents an algorithm, RRT*-AR, to generate alternate routes in real time by making tradeoffs in exploitation for exploration, precision for speed and leveraging assumptions about the vehicle and environment constraints. In the case of emergency landing of a helicopter, RRT*-AR outperformed RRT* by providing the human 280{\%} more flight paths 67{\%} faster on average. By planning multiple routes to potential landing zones, the planner was able to seamlessly switch to a new landing site without having to replan.},

abstract = {Sampling-based optimal planners, such as RRT∗, almost-surely converge asymptotically to the optimal solution, but have provably slow convergence rates in high dimensions. This is because their commitment to finding the global optimum compels them to prioritize exploration of the entire problem domain even as its size grows exponentially. Optimization techniques, such as CHOMP, have fast convergence on these problems but only to local optima. This is because they are exploitative, prioritizing the immediate improvement of a path even though this may not find the global optimum of nonconvex cost functions.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of autonomous navigation of a micro aerial vehicle (MAV) for inspection and damage assessment inside a constrained shipboard environment, which might be perilous or inaccessible for humans, especially in emergency scenarios. The environment is GPS-denied and visually degraded, containing narrow passageways, doorways, and small objects protruding from the wall. This causes existing two-dimensional LIDAR, vision, or mechanical bumper-based autonomous navigation solutions to fail. To realize autonomous navigation in such challenging environments, we first propose a robust state estimation method that fuses estimates from a real-time odometry estimation algorithm and a particle filtering localization algorithm with other sensor information in a two-layer fusion framework. Then, an online motion-planning algorithm that combines trajectory optimization with a receding horizon control framework is proposed for fast obstacle avoidance. All the computations are done in real time on the onboard computer. We validate the system by running experiments under different environmental conditions in both laboratory and practical shipboard environments. The field experiment results of over 10 runs show that our vehicle can robustly navigate 20-m-long and only 1-m-wide corridors and go through a very narrow doorway (66-cm width, only 4-cm clearance on each side) autonomously even when it is completely dark or full of light smoke. These experiments show that despite the challenges associated with flying robustly in challenging shipboard environments, it is possible to use a MAV to autonomously fly into a confined shipboard environment to rapidly gather situational information to guide firefighting and rescue efforts.},

An autonomous landing system could react quicker to regain control, however current emergency landing methods only generate dynamically feasible trajectories without considering obstacles. We address the problem of autonomously landing a helicopter while considering a realistic context: multiple potential landing zones, geographical terrain, sensor limitations and pilot contextual knowledge. We designed a planning system to generate alternate routes (AR) that respect these factors till touchdown exploiting the human-in-loop to make a choice. This paper presents an algorithm, RRT*-AR, building upon the optimal sampling-based algorithm RRT* to generate AR in realtime and examines its performance for simulated failures occurring in mountainous terrain, while maintaining optimality guarantees. After over 4500 trials, RRT*-AR outperformed RRT* by providing the human 280{\%} more options 67{\%} faster on average. As a result, it provides a much wider safety margin for unaccounted disturbances, and a more secure environment for a pilot.

While cameras are the most common sensor used for semantic classification, the performance of methods using camera imagery may suffer when there is significant variation between the train and testing sets caused by illumination, weather, and seasonal variations. On the other hand, 3D information from active sensors such as LiDAR is comparatively invariant to these factors, which motivates us to investigate whether it can be used to improve performance in this scenario. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture consisting of two streams, 2D and 3D, which are fused by projecting 3D features to image space to achieve a robust pixelwise semantic segmentation. We evaluate our proposed method in a novel off-road terrain classification benchmark, and show a 25{\%} improvement in mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of navigation-related semantic classes, relative to an image-only baseline.},

The need for accurate segmentation in a wide variety of riverine environments challenges the state of the art vision-based methods that have been used in more structured environments such as roads and highways. Apart from the lack of structure, the principal difficulty is the large spatial and temporal variations in the appearance of water in the presence of nearby vegetation and with reflections from the sky. We propose a self-supervised method to segment images into 'sky', 'river' and 'shore' (vegetation + structures) regions. Our approach uses assumptions about river scene structure to learn appearance models based on features like color, texture and image location which are used to segment the image. We validated our algorithm by testing on four datasets captured under varying conditions on different rivers. Our self-supervised algorithm had higher accuracy rates than a supervised alternative, often significantly more accurate, and does not need to be retrained to work under different conditions. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

The presence of wind, which acts like a forcing function on the system dynamics, significantly affects control authority and flight times. While there is a large body of work on the individual topics of planning long missions and path planning in wind fields, these methods do not scale to solve the combined problem under real-time constraints. In this paper, we address the problem of planning long, dynamically feasible, time-optimal trajectories in the presence of wind for a full-scale helicopter. We build on our existing algorithm, kITE, which accounts for wind in a principled and elegant way, and produces dynamically-feasible trajectories that are guaranteed to be safe in near real-time. It uses a novel framework to decouple path optimization in a fixed ground frame from velocity optimization in a moving air frame. We present extensive experimental evaluation of kITE on an autonomous helicopter platform (with a human safety pilot in the loop) with data from over 23 missions in winds up to 20m=s and airspeeds up to 50m=s. Our results not only shows the efficacy of the algorithm and its implementation, but also provide insights into failure cases that we encountered.

abstract = {As part of swarm search and service (SSS) missions, swarms are tasked with searching an area while simultaneously servicing jobs as they are encountered. Jobs must be immediately serviced and can be one of multiple types. Each type requires that vehicle(s) break off from the swarm and travel to the job site for a specified amount of time. The number of vehicles needed and the service time for each job type are known. Once a job has been successfully serviced, vehicles return to the swarm and are available for reallocation. When planning SSS missions, human operators are tasked with determining the required number of vehicles needed to handle the expected job demand. The complex relationship between job type parameters makes this choice challenging. This work presents a prediction model used to estimate the swarm size necessary to achieve a given performance. User studies were conducted to determine the usefulness and ease of use of such a prediction model as an aid during mission planning.

Approaches to non-linear optimization, such as differential dynamic programming (DDP), suffer from the drawbacks of slow convergence by being limited to stay within the trust-region of the linearized dynamics and having to integrate the dynamics with fine granularity at each iteration. We address the problem of decoupling the workspace optimization from the enforcement of non-linear constraints. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamics Projection Filter, a nonlinear projection operator based approach that first optimizes a workspace trajectory with reduced constraints and then projects (filters) it to a feasible configuration space trajectory that has a bounded sub-optimality guarantee. We show simulation results for various curvature and curvature-derivatives constrained systems, where the dynamics projection filter is able to, on average, produce similar quality solution 50 times faster than DDP. We also show results from flight tests on an autonomous helicopter that solved these problems on-line while avoiding mountains at high speed as well as trees and buildings as it came in to land.},

In this paper, we examine the problem of motion planning on a resolution constrained lattice for a robot with non-linear dynamics operating in an environment with randomly generated disc shaped obstacles sampled from a homogeneous Poisson process. We present a unified framework for computing explicit solutions to two problems - i) the critical planning resolution which guarantees the existence of an infinite collision free trajectory in the search graph ii) the critical speed limit which guarantees infinite collision free motion. In contrast to techniques used by Karaman and Frazzoli [11], we use a novel approach that maps the problem to parameters of directed asymmetric hexagonal lattice bond percolation. Since standard percolation theory offers no results for this lattice, we map the lattice to an infinite absorbing Markov chain and use results pertaining to its survival to obtain bounds on the parameters. As a result, we are able to derive theoretical expressions that relate the non-linear dynamics of a robot, the resolution of the search graph and the density of the Poisson process. We validate the theoretical bounds using Monte-Carlo simulations for single integrator and curvature constrained systems and are able to validate the previous results presented by Karaman and Frazzoli [11] independently using the novel connections introduced in this paper.},

abstract = {Autonomous bridge inspection operations using unmanned aerial vehicles take multiple task assignments and constraints into account. To efficiently execute the operations, a schedule is required. Generating a cost optimum schedule of multiple-unmanned aerial vehicle operations is known to be Non-deterministic Polynomial-time (NP)-hard. This study approaches such a problem with heuristic-based algorithms to get a high-quality feasible solution in a short computation time. A constructive heuristic called Retractable Chain Task Assignment algorithm is presented to build an evaluable schedule from a task sequence. The task sequence representation is used during the search to perform seamless operations. Retractable Chain Task Assignment algorithm calculates and incorporates slack time to the schedule according to the properties of the task. The slack time acts as a cushion which makes the schedule delay-tolerant. This algorithm is incorporated with a metaheuristic algorithm called Multi-strategy Coevolution to search the solution space. The proposed algorithm is verified through numerical simulations, which take inputs from real flight test data. The obtained solutions are evaluated based on the makespan, battery consumption, computation time, and the robustness level of the schedules. The performance of Multi-strategy Coevolution is compared to Differential Evolution, Particle Swarm Optimization, and Differential Evolution–Fused Particle Swarm Optimization. The simulation results show that Multi-strategy Coevolution gives better objective values than the other algorithms.},

abstract = {With the universal application of camera in intelligent vehicles, visual place recognition has become a major problem in intelligent vehicle localization. The traditional solution is to make visual description of place images using hand-crafted feature for matching places, but this description method is not very good for extreme variability, especially for seasonal transformation. In this paper, we propose a new method based on convolutional neural network (CNN), by putting images into the pre-trained network model to get automatically learned image descriptors, and through some operations of pooling, fusion and binarization to optimize them, then the similarity result of place recognition is presented with the Hamming distance of the place sequence. In the experimental part, we compare our method with some state-of-the-art algorithms, FABMAP, ABLE-M and SeqSLAM, to illustrate its advantages. The experimental results show that our method based on CNN achieves better performance than other methods on the representative public datasets.},

abstract = {Robust object recognition is a crucial skill for robots operating autonomously in real world environments. Range sensors such as LiDAR and RGBD cameras are increasingly found in modern robotic systems, providing a rich source of 3D information that can aid in this task. However, many current systems do not fully utilize this information and have trouble efficiently dealing with large amounts of point cloud data. In this paper, we propose VoxNet, an architecture to tackle this problem by integrating a volumetric Occupancy Grid representation with a supervised 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN). We evaluate our approach on publicly available benchmarks using LiDAR, RGBD, and CAD data. VoxNet achieves accuracy beyond the state of the art while labeling hundreds of instances per second.},

abstract = {Wire detection is a key capability for safe navigation of autonomous aerial vehicles and is a challenging problem as wires are generally only a few pixels wide, can appear at any orientation and location, and are hard to distinguish from other similar looking lines and edges. We leverage the recent advances in deep learning by treating wire detection as a semantic segmentation task, and investigate the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks for the same. To find an optimal model in terms of detection accuracy and real time performance on a portable GPU, we perform a grid search over a finite space of architectures. Further, to combat the issue of unavailability of a large public dataset with annotations, we render synthetic wires using a ray tracing engine, and overlay them on 67K images from flight videos available on the internet. We use this synthetic dataset for pretraining our models before finetuning on real data, and show that synthetic data alone can lead to pretty accurate detections qualitatively as well. We also verify if providing explicit information about local evidence of wiry-ness in the form of edge and line detection results from a traditional computer vision method, as additional channels to the network input, makes the task easier or not. We evaluate our best models from the grid search on a publicly available dataset and show that they outperform previous work using traditional computer vision and various deep net baselines of FCNs, SegNet and E-Net, on both standard edge detection metrics and inference speed. Our top models run at more than 3Hz on the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 with input resolution of 480×640, with an Average Precision score of 0.73 on our test split of the USF dataset.},

abstract={The Urban Challenge represents a technological leap beyond the previous Grand Challenges. The challenge encompasses three primary behaviors: driving on roads, handling intersections and maneuvering in zones. In implementing urban driving we have decomposed the problem into five components. Mission Planning determines an efficient route through an urban network of roads. A behavioral layer executes the route through the environment, adapting to local traffic and exceptional situations as necessary. A motion planning layer safeguards the robot by considering the feasible trajectories available, and selecting the best option. Perception combines data from lidar, radar and vision systems to estimate the location of other vehicles, static obstacles and the shape of the road. Finally, the robot is a mechatronic system engineered to provide the power, sensing and mobility necessary to navigate an urban course. Rigorous component and system testing evaluates progress using standardized tests. Observations from these experiments shape the design of subsequent development spirals and enable the rapid detection and correction of bugs. The system described in the paper exhibits a majority of the basic navigation and traffic skills required for the Urban Challenge. From these building blocks more advanced capabilities will quickly develop.},
