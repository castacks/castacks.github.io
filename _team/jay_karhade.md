Hello! I'm a 1st year PhD student in the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. Previously, I was an MSR student at the AirLab. Even before, I was a carefree undergrad from BITS Hyderabad in India.

My goal is to build generalized perception systems that can create multi-modal and spatio-temporal representations that reconstruct and reason about the environment. In this pursuit, my work often lies at the intersection of Computer Vision, Robotics and Graphics.
