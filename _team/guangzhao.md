Guangzhao(Zack) Li is an M.R.S.D student at Carnegie Mellon University. His primary interest lies in autonomous robotics and its commercialization in the markets, such as (field) service robots and self-driving cars. While currently working on learning-based exploration projects, he loves playing piano and Chopin is my favorite. He also grew up with ice hockey and badminton. As a certified AASI snowboard instructor, I often teach my friends tricks in terrain parks and halfpipes.
