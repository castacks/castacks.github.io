Amikosh (Avi) is a Master’s student in Civil and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. He graduated from Purdue University with a B.S. in Computer Engineering.

Avi’s expertise in autonomous systems is founded on four years of leading drone swarm simulation research @ Purdue University under Professor. Sundaram. He complemented this academic leadership with deep industry experience over three consecutive internships @ SAAB, where he engineered real-time perception pipelines and sensor fusion models in Unreal Engine. This blend of research and industry application forms the core of his technical capabilities.

Now a Master's student at Carnegie Mellon, Avi is focused on the next generation of robotics. At AirLabs, his work bridges foundational simulation with real-world industry challenges; he is enhancing the AirStack simulator while also developing physical autonomous drone systems. These projects are the first step in his broader research goal: to build general-purpose robots by integrating physical AI with large language models, transformers, and advanced vision systems, creating intelligent agents that can understand and interact with the physical world.
