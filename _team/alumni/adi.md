Hi there, this is Adi.

I am a Research Engineer at Airlab, working on multi-modal, multi-task learning within multi-agent scenarios. I recently graduated with a Master of Science in Robotics from Carnegie Mellon University, where I focused on 3D computer vision, large-scale training, and reinforcement learning.
