Matthew is a current PhD Student. He previously completed M.S. in Robotics and took a year off to work at KEF robotics. Prior to joining CMU, he graduated from the University of Pittsburgh with a B.S. in computer engineering and a minor in biomedical engineering.

His research involves developing robust perception methods for autonomous navigation, specifically off-road driving. Currently he is exploring methods at the intersection of self-supervised learning, uncertainty awareness, and online learnin. He is additionally interested in the roles of artistic and human-inspired concepts in decision-making.

In his free time, he enjoys tennis, climbing, baking, and playing piano for various student productions.
