Hi! I'm Neelay, a 1st year PhD student in the CMU Robotics Institute and an NSF GRFP Fellow. I previously completed my undergrad at UC San Diego in Computer Engineering.

I'm interested in enabling robots to adapt online to unexpected/out-of-distribution conditions and failure modes. I'm specifically exploring how closely integrating planning and perception, e.g. active perception, informed path planning, etc., can help achieve this goal.
