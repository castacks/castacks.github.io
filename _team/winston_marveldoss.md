Hey, My name is Winston. I am currently a MS Robotics (MSR) student at CMU. My research focus is to develop robust perception system for autonomous robots. My long-term vision is to make autonomous driving a reality on indian roads!
Within the AirLab, I am currently involved in the off-road driving project and the DARPA Triage Challenge.
