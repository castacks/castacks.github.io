I"À<p>Congratulations to Team Explorer (CMU + OSU SubT Team) for winning the tunnel circuit of the DARPA Subterranean Challenge. In this circuit, each team needed to deploy robots to autonomously map and search in tunnel systems that â€œcan extend many kilometers in length with constrained passages, vertical shafts and multiple levels.â€ Our team outscored 10 other teams, winning first place as well as the â€œMost Accurate Artifactâ€ award.</p>
