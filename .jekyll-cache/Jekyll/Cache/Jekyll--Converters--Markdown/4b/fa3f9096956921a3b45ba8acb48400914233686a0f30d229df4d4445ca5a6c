I"Ï	<p>This dataset included the energy usage for hundreds of drone flights in varying configurations and conditions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This experiment was performed in order to empirically measure the energy use of small, electric Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). We autonomously direct a DJI Â® Matrice 100 (M100) drone to take off, carry a range of payload weights on a triangular flight pattern, and land. Between flights, we varied specified parameters through a set of discrete options, payload of 0 , 250 g and 500 g; altitude during cruise of 25 m, 50 m, 75 m and 100 m; and speed during cruise of 4 m/s, 6 m/s, 8 m/s, 10 m/s and 12 m/s.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The number of flights performed varying operational parameters (payload, altitude, speed) was 195. In addition, 14 recordings were done to assess the droneâ€™s ancillary power and hover conditions.</p>
