Over the years our lab our lab has created various open-source planning packages. This list is by no means comprehensive, and you can find all our our open-source code on [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/castacks/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/castacks).

Please click on a package to for details and how to use it.

* [Planning Tutorial](https://bitbucket.org/castacks/planning_tutorial/src/master/) This is a tutorial repository for setting up a planning module. This short tutorial will walk you through the requisite steps for setting up a workspace with required packages. We will then go over an example. Finally, we will go over some exercises.
* [Matlab Planning Toolbox](https://bitbucket.org/castacks/matlab_planning_toolbox/src) Matlab toolbox to explore and understand different motion planning algorithms.
<!-- * <a href="https://bitbucket.org/kostas-alexis/matlab_safe_navigation">Matlab Safe Navigation</a> Matlab toolbox to explore and understand exploration algorithms. -->
* <a href="https://bitbucket.org/castacks/matlab_environment_generation">Matlab Environment Generation</a> This is a MATLAB package to define an environment as a grid map or a shape array. This package defines operations on the environment such as collision checking, distance calculation, visualization etc.
* <a href="https://bitbucket.org/castacks/matlab_cost_functions">Matlab Cost Functions</a> This MATLAB package defines an interface for using a cost map. This is commonly used by trajectory optimization packages and planning packages in MATLAB.
* <a href="https://bitbucket.org/castacks/matlab_chomp">Matlab Chomp</a> Matlab toolbox to explore chomp.
* <a href="https://bitbucket.org/castacks/representation_interface">Representation Interface</a> This repository defines an interface for planning code to access perception data-structures.
* <a href="https://bitbucket.org/castacks/boustrophedon_decomposition">Boustrophedon Decomposition</a> Boustrophedon_decompostion is cell decomposition of known map and create right to left and left to right path for each subcell and connect all the cells in shortest distance fashion.
