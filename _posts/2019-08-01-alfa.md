The *AirLab Failure and Anomaly* (*ALFA*) Dataset includes the data collected from tens of autonomous flights for failure detection and anomaly detection research. The data is provided in 4 collections:

***- Processed Data:*** 47 sequences of fully autonomous flight sequences with eight different types of faults happening during the flights. The files include the ground truth of the type and the time of the failure and are provided in the ROS **.bag** format, as well as in **.csv** and **.mat** formats. The original **.bag** files are recorded using the modified [mavros](http://wiki.ros.org/mavros) ROS package connected to the Pixhawk running the modified Ardupilot 3.9.0beta1 through [MAVLink 2.0](https://mavlink.io/en/) protocol. 

***- Raw Bag Files:*** The raw .bag files of the flights. It contains both the manual and autonomous flight sequences collected during the flights, without any processing. These files are recorded using the modified [mavros](http://wiki.ros.org/mavros) ROS package connected to the Pixhawk running the modified Ardupilot 3.9.0beta1 through [MAVLink](https://mavlink.io/en/) protocol.  

***- Telemetry Logs:*** The telemetry logs from the onboard NVidia TX2 computer connected to the Pixhawk autopilot.  

***- Dataflash Logs:*** The logs recorded on the Pixhawk during the flights. A supplemental code is provided for working with the dataset in C++, Python and MATLAB. The codes are written independent of ROS or any other external library and are cross-platform (tested in Linux, Mac OS and Windows). The dataset was collected during our research on a novel real-time anomaly detection method for autonomous aerial vehicles. More information about the project is available on the project page [(link)](http://theairlab.org/fault-detection/).

Two publications provide the description of the dataset (including the structure, data collection, etc.). Please proceed to the citation section for more details. 

### Processed Sequences

The main focus of ALFA dataset is the processed data sequences. The list of the sequences is as followed:
